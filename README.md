# Heya, my name is Jody 👋

I guess I will share my development exploration here as I shift back to primarily pursuing web/blockchain development. Building off a long WordPress history, I've explored the Jamstack world to solve problems. Now going back in time to inscribe my content library forever on Bitcoin ordinals, and exploring powerful software with WordPress and a GPT-5 Scaffolding consultant alongside a Claude CLI dev team that is better than I had at an agency.
